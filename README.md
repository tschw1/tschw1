# Hello there 👋

### My name is Toni, I’m 20 years old, and I currently work as a corporate student in business IT 📊💻

In the past, I was coding some basic websites and Python projects like Discord bots. I also wrote a few Python scripts at work to automate user management with APIs. Those were my first „real“ projects with a clear purpose, and they were quite exciting 🙂

I’m primarily focused on Python coding, but I’m eager to learn more about web development at the moment 📖. In web development, I really appreciate how quickly you can create small applications with JavaScript frameworks like NestJs. You build a quick backend, connect a database, and you’re ready to supply your frontend with data 💾

Unfortunately, my skills in this area aren’t very advanced yet. However, as a corporate student, I’ve been approved for GitHub Education! I hope to find some courses or developer tools/resources there that will help me learn new things 🤓

If you’d like to join me on my journey, watch me struggle, celebrate, and everything in between. Feel free to check out my profile and leave some feedback if you wish 😇

Oh, and by the way, I’m from Germany 🇩🇪. So sometimes when I’m coding at 2 am, my brain isn’t braning, and the translation processes become a bit overwhelming. If you come across any oddly worded commits here, that’s probably the reason 🫩😂
