# Hi there 👋

### I'm Toni, 20 years old and currently I work as a corporate student in business IT 📊💻

I was coding in the past on some basic websites and Python projects like Discord bots. 
I was also writing a few Python scripts at work to automate user management with APIs. That was pretty cool because those were my first "real" projects that really had a purpose 🙂 

So right now I am mostly into Python coding, but I want to learn web developement a bit right now 📖. I really like how quickly you can build small apps with Js Frameworks like NestJs. You build a quick backend, link a database and you're ready to feed your frontend with some data 💾 

Sadly my skills in this area aren't really advanced. But thanks to being a corporate student I got approved for GitHub Education! So I hope I'll find a few courses or developer tools/resources there that will help me to learn a few new things 🤓

So if you want to accompany me on my journey. Watch me suffer, celebrate and everything in between. Then feel free to take a look at my profile and leave a bit of feedback if you want 😇

Oh and I am from Germany 🇩🇪 btw, so sometimes when I'm coding at 2am my brain isn't really braining anymore and the translation processes are a bit too much. So if you're reading any weird sounding commits here, that's probably because of that 🫩😂
